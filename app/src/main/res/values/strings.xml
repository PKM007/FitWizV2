They can be done from virtually anywhere and don’t require any equipment.</string>
    <string name="jumpingjack">Jumping jack – is a classic cardio exercise that speeds up your heartbeat without additional equipment. This energy-intensive exercise will burn a lot of calories and tighten outer and inner thighs, quads, deltoid muscles and the latissimus dorsi. Jumping jack is a plyometric exercise where the muscles of the whole body engage. This exercise can be a warm-up, but its implementation for a long period is already a serious cardio workout.</string>

    <string name="dfd">If you only have time for one in the morning, I’d make it this one. The whole body’s involved so it’s a great way to wake up every part of your physique. That beautiful stretch through the backs of the legs and hips just feels incredible. </string>
    <string name="ll">I’ve got a problematic psoas muscle that likes to grip and shorten any chance it can get, so Anjaneyasana is like a bubble bath for my hip flexors. You get that lovely open stretchy feeling through the hips, arms and torso, and it also builds strength in the legs.</string>
