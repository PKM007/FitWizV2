    <string name="squat">Most people skip squats because they’re hard. They use excuses like “Squats are bad for the knees”. But, put bluntly, if you’re not Squatting every week, using free weights, and breaking parallel on every rep, your training program is ineffective.</string>
    <string name="crunch">As a core-training exercise, crunches help improve your balance by strengthening your abdominal muscles. Strong core muscles improve your posture, which helps you function efficiently in everyday life and in sporting events. A healthy posture also helps prevent lower back pain and muscle injury.</string>
    <string name="pushup">Traditional pushups are beneficial for building upper body strength. They work the triceps, pectoral muscles, and shoulders. When done with proper form, they can also strengthen the lower back and core by engaging (pulling in) the abdominal muscles. Pushups are a fast and effective exercise for building strength. They can be done from virtually anywhere and don’t require any equipment.</string>
    <string name="jumpingjack">Jumping jack – is a classic cardio exercise that speeds up your heartbeat without additional equipment. This energy-intensive exercise will burn a lot of calories and tighten outer and inner thighs, quads, deltoid muscles and the latissimus dorsi. Jumping jack is a plyometric exercise where the muscles of the whole body engage. This exercise can be a warm-up, but its implementation for a long period is already a serious cardio workout.</string>
    <string name="glutebridge">You should feel the burn in your glutes and your hamstrings if you’re doing it correctly. The bridge is also great for improving hip mobility and strengthening your lower back, two things that any desk-bound worker can really benefit from.</string>
    <string name="sn">There are several variations to this sequence of postures known as salute to the sun. They’re traditionally practiced as the sun is rising, and whichever version of Surya Namaskar you practice, they’re a great way to warm up and start to sync movement of the body with the flow of the breath.</string>
    <string name="ut">It’s most commonly called Chair Pose, Call it what you will, Utkatasana is an amazing way to generate heat in the body and quickly build energy. It activates the core and the legs and challenges your mind to stay present and positive, all great benefits for a morning practice.</string>
    <string name="pu">I mean, if you’re going to go to all the trouble of sitting down in your not-so-comfy Chair, you might as well get the twisting benefits of the revolved variation right?! Twisting poses have a squeeze and release effect on your digestive system and internal organs so they help promote detoxification.</string>
    <string name="dfd">If you only have time for one in the morning, I’d make it this one. The whole body’s involved so it’s a great way to wake up every part of your physique. That beautiful stretch through the backs of the legs and hips just feels incredible. </string>
    <string name="ll">I’ve got a problematic psoas muscle that likes to grip and shorten any chance it can get, so Anjaneyasana is like a bubble bath for my hip flexors. You get that lovely open stretchy feeling through the hips, arms and torso, and it also builds strength in the legs.</string>
    <string name="triangle">One of the classic yoga asanas, Trikonasana helps to give you a strong sense of grounding and stability through activating and balancing the root chakra, Muladhara. It powers up the legs and core, and the subtle twist allows you to open and light up the heart space. Beautiful.</string>
